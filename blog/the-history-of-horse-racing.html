                    <p>Horse racing is one of the sports which is practised from a very ancient era. It has a long
                        history. There are a lot of archeological records indicating that horse racing occurred in
                        Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Babylon, Syria, and Egypt. Myths and legends also indicate this
                        sport, such as the contest between the steeds of the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir in Norse
                        mythology.
                    </p>
                    <p>Even though nowadays mounted horse racing is popular, both chariot and mounted horse
                        racing were events in the ancient Greek Olympics by 648 BCE and were important in the other
                        Panhellenic Games. It continued although chariot racing was often dangerous to both driver and
                        horse, which frequently suffered serious injury and even death. In the Roman Empire, chariot and
                        mounted horse racing were major industries. From the mid-fifteenth, spring carnival in Rome
                        closed with a horse race. Fifteen to 20 riderless horses, originally imported from the Barbary
                        Coast of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the Via del Corso, a long, straight
                        city street; their time was about two and a half minutes.</p>

                    <p>In later periods, Thoroughbred racing became, and still remains, popular with aristocrats and
                        royalty of British society, earning it the title "Sport of Kings".</p>
                    <p>Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian competitions
                        entertained spectators while showcasing the superior horsemanship required for combat. All forms
                        of horse racing began as spontaneous contests between riders or drivers. The different
                        competitions, which called for difficult and specialised skills from both horse and rider, led
                        to the methodical development of specialised breeds and equipment for each sport. During the
                        ages, the popularity of equestrian activities has allowed for the preservation of techniques
                        that would have otherwise been lost once horses stopped being used in warfare.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the 18th century, horse racing flourished in Britain. In the 18th century and
                        thereafter, its popularity grew steadily. King Charles II, a devoted sports fan who ruled from
                        1649 to 1685, was responsible for Newmarket's fame. He gave Newmarket its prominence. By 1750
                        the Jockey Club was formed to control the Newmarket races, set the rules of the game, prevent
                        dishonesty, and make for a level field. Beginning in 1780, Epsom Derby. The St. Leger Stakes
                        marked the start of the five classic events in 1776. Five yearly races were included when the
                        system was finished in 1814.</p>
                    <img src="./../img/racing-post-2.jpg" width="100%" height=""/>
                    <p>The benchmarks were set by Newmarket and the Jockey Club, but the majority of the races were held
                        in landowners' fields and in the burgeoning towns for huge amounts of local prestige and tiny
                        financial payouts. All social classes, from the working class to royalty, took part in the
                        wagering system, which was crucial to the financing and expansion of the industry. High society
                        was in charge and made a special effort to keep the riff-raff and criminal element out of the
                        betting area. The system required knowledgeable jockeys, trainers, grooms, and experts in
                        breeding since real money was on the line, which created new, prominent jobs for rural
                        working-class men. Every young ambitious stable boy could dream of making it big. </p>

                    <p>Horse racing is one of the few sports that continued during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, with
                        Australian and Hong Kong the two main racing jurisdictions to carry on, albeit with no crowds.
                        The USA, United Kingdom and France were some of the more prominent racing bodies to either
                        postpone or cancel all events.
